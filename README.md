Hi. 

I'm Delaney. I work at [Protect Democracy](https://protectdemocracy.org/) 🇺🇸 for the [VoteShield](https://voteshield.us/about) 🛡 project.

I primarily work in Python, R, and SQL doing general analysis and data visualization as it serves our mission. I have a background in statistical programming and research from my time at the 🐊 University of Florida, where I studied statistics and was a member of the [Election Science Group](https://electionscience.clas.ufl.edu/). 

Interested in civic tech or election data? 📈 Here are some of my favorite resources:

- [ProPublica Data Store](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/) 
- [United States Github](https://github.com/unitedstates)
- [GovTrack](https://www.govtrack.us/about-our-data)
- [OpenElections](http://openelections.net/)
- [US Elections Project](http://www.electproject.org/) and [VEST](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/electionscience)
